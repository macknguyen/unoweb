                Hi Everyone, 
                My name is Mackenzie Nguyen. My favourite go to board game has always been UNO, being an easy game to pick up by anybody.
                This game can be enjoyed for however long you want to play. 
                <p>I've always had a thrill when it comes to making comebacks in games, which UNO can definitely satisfy me with, being able to win with a hand of 20 cards against 1. </p>
                <p>This game has been a go to board game ever since I started playing card games, it has made a lot of good memories and also some bad memories but overall it helped me into 
                building the skills I can use outside of UNO for multiple benefits.
            </p>
            <center>
                <h2>Motive behind UNO?</h2>
            </center>
            <p>
                <p>I wanted to share my passion of UNO and hope to see more people playing this wonderful game, it has greatly build my strategy, 
                and problem solving skills. Once you are able to pick up a game of UNO, you can learn any type of card games easily through the
                foundation you will build by playing UNO.</p>
                <p>I hope my website can help you light up a spark that will make you enjoy this game. 
                This game can help you spend a lot of quality time with your loved ones and can be a fun challenging game to compete against.</p>
            </p>
