                                <div class="info-body">
                                    <p>Uno is a popular card game that is played with a special deck of cards. The rules of Uno are as follows: </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The game is played with a deck of 108 cards, which includes four sets of cards numbered 0 to 9 in four different colors, as well as eight "Skip" cards, eight "Draw Two" cards, eight "Reverse" cards, and four "Wild" cards.</li>
                                        <li>The game is typically played with two to ten players, but the optimal number of players is three to six.</li>
                                        <li>The objective of the game is to be the first player to get rid of all of your cards.</li>
                                        <li>At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt seven cards, and the remaining cards are placed face down in a draw pile.</li>
                                        <li>The player to the left of the dealer goes first, and play proceeds clockwise.</li>
                                        <li>On a player's turn, they must play one card from their hand that matches either the color or the number of the card on the top of the discard pile. If a player cannot play a card, they must draw one card from the draw pile. If that card can be played, they may play it, but if not, their turn ends.</li>
                                        <li>If a player plays a "Skip" card, the next player in turn is skipped, and they must forfeit their turn.</li>
                                        <li>If a player plays a "Draw Two" card, the next player in turn must draw two cards from the draw pile and forfeit their turn.</li>
                                        <li>If a player plays a "Reverse" card, the direction of play is reversed, and the player to the right of the current player goes next.</li>
                                        <li>If a player plays a "Wild" card, they must choose a color, and the next player in turn must play a card of that color or another "Wild" card. If a player plays a "Wild Draw Four" card, they must choose a color, and the next player in turn must draw four cards from the draw pile and forfeit their turn.</li>
                                        <li>The game ends when a player has no cards remaining in their hand. That player is the winner, and the other players receive points based on the number of cards remaining in their hands. The first player to reach a certain number of points (typically 500) is the loser.</li>
                                    </ul>

                    <div class="info-body">
                        <p>Uno is a popular card game that was invented in 1971 by Merle Robbins, a barber from Ohio. Robbins created the game with his family and friends, and it quickly became a hit among them. He then decided to sell the game through his own company, International Games Inc.</p>
                        <p>Over the years, Uno has become one of the most popular card games in the world, and it has been translated into many different languages. It has also inspired numerous spin-off games, such as Uno Attack, Uno Spin, and Uno Moo.</p>
                        <p>In 1992, International Games Inc. was acquired by Mattel, which now owns the rights to the game. Today, Uno is sold in over 80 countries, and it has become a staple of family game nights and social gatherings around the world.</p>

                        <h2 class="info-title">Tips and Strategies for Winning UNO</h2>
                        <div class="info-body">
                            <p>Here are some tips and strategies for winning Uno:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Pay attention to the cards that have been played and the colors that have been called. This will help you anticipate what cards your opponents might have and what cards you should hold on to.</li>

                                <li>Use your "Skip" and "Reverse" cards strategically. If you have a "Skip" card, save it for when you want to skip an opponent who is close to winning. Similarly, if you have a "Reverse" card, save it for when you want to change the direction of play and potentially skip an opponent who is close to winning.</li>
                                
                                <li>Try to get rid of your high-value cards early in the game. Cards with high point values, such as the "Draw Two" and "Wild Draw Four" cards, can quickly add up and hurt your chances of winning.</li>
                                
                                <li>Hold on to your "Wild" and "Wild Draw Four" cards for as long as possible. These cards can be used to your advantage, as you can choose the color that is most advantageous to you.</li>
                                
                                <li>Don't forget to call "Uno" when you have one card left in your hand. Failure to do so can result in a penalty.</li>
                                
                                <li>Be observant of your opponents' behavior and body language. They may inadvertently give away information about the cards they hold.</li>
                                
                                <li>If you have a choice between playing a card that matches the color of the previous card or playing a card that matches the number, always choose the color. This will give you more options in future turns.</li>
                                
                                <li>Consider playing defensively if you are close to winning. This means playing cards that will make it more difficult for your opponents to get rid of their cards, such as "Reverse" and "Draw Two" cards.</li>
                                
                            </ul>
                            <p>Uno is ultimately a game of luck, so it's important to have fun and enjoy the experience, regardless of whether you win or lose.</p>
